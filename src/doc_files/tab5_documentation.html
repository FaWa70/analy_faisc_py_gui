<h2>Aim of this program</h2>
<p>This program aims to describe (peaked) spatial beam profiles of laser beams. 
The first 3 tabs are used to analyze a stack of images that were all taken 
at the same position with the same laser and setup settings. 
(If all instruments were perfect, all images in a stack would be identical.) 
In order to get the characteristic numbers of the beam profile and their 
uncertainties we go through 3 steps, one per tab. </p>
<p><b>TAB 1 (compulsory): </b>  Indicate the location of the images by selecting one 
(loads all images of the same stack); crop them to a size that leaves 
enough surface around the beam to determine the background level; select the 
region of interest (ROI) that separates the beam zone from the background zone; 
possibly smooth out isolated noise pixels 
by median-filtering the images; possibly select the part of the stack that 
contains valid images (exclude zero-images (compulsory) and background images 
(optional)) if they are contained in a contiguous region of the stack. </p>
<p><b>TAB 2 (compulsory): </b> Set the way how the good images of the stack should be analyzed. 
Several options for determination of the background grey-level (GL) and the 
maximum GL are available. You can also fit some analytic beam profiles to 
your data. </p>
<p><b>TAB 3: </b> Launch the stack analysis; inspect the histograms; possibly discard 
some images based on the histograms (for example images with strong background or
    with strangely small energy); possibly export an MS-Excel xlsx-file with the data. </p>
<p>
<p><b>TAB 4: </b> Launch the analysis of several stacks corresponding to different
z positions; check out the z-curves; possibly export an MS-Excel xlsx-file with the data. </p>

<h2>Tab1: Loading images and defining the ROI</h2>
<p> The upper left button 'Load file' opens a file dialog. The program can read a
stack of images provided in two ways: </p>
<p><b>1. </b>The contents of a 64-image wcf-file which was written by the DataRay
software of the WinCam beam profiling cameras. </p>
<p><b>2. </b>All image files (*.tif, *.jpg, *.png) that have the same size (pixels)
and that are stored in the same directory. </p>
<p>After loading, information on the images is displayed in the first line
(path/filename; image size and format). </p>
<p>The slider and the arrow buttons allow to look at all the images one-by-one
(frame-by-frame mode). The color map and its limits can be chosen on the right
side. Using this feature can help to define the region the of interest without 
intersecting with the "foothills" of the beam profile (see figure below). 
A tiled overview-mode of all downsampled stack images is also available. 
(Radio buttons below the slider.)</p>

<br>FIG 1: <i>How to use the color map limits to better define the ROI.</i>
</p>
<p>Up to now the Pixel size input under the 'Load file' button is not used.
All lateral output is in pixels (px).
All vertical output is in grey levels (GL). </p>
<p>First the full images are displayed with the crop frame in a dashed white
line. The crop frame can be modified using the 4 spinboxes (smaller increments
than the default are possible by writing in the boxes). Care should be taken
to keep enough space around or besides the beam, where the background is visible.
Best keep a dark frame with a width of a beam radius around outer edge of the
beam. For better visibility of the outer beam edge you can switch the color map if
necessary. Finally, activate the cropping by using the checkbox ('apply crop margins')
near the cropping spinboxes. (The crop margins are maintained when loading a new image
stack.) </p>
<p>After cropping the ROI has to be selected. The rectangular ROI will delimit the region
where the background signal is extracted from. Best use it to delimit a black frame
around the beam (with some safety margin). To select the ROI, check the checkbox
'redefine' below the label 'ROI I' and <b>click on the image</b>. The display of a red
dashed cross will help you to choose the first edge of the rectangle. So <b>place the
mouse</b> at the right position <b>and push the key</b> <b>&lt;h&gt;</b> on your keyboard to confirm. Then
choose the second edge and confirm with <b>&lt;n&gt;</b>. The key actions do not work if you
    did not first click on the image.</p>
<p>The last compulsory action on this tab is to check that the range of good images does
not contain any images that are completely at zero. (These would crash the calculations
on tab 2.) Best, define the range of good images such that only valid images of the same
type are contained. In this version of the program only one region of the stack can be
excluded in its center (from &gt; to) or first and last images can be excluded (from &lt; to).
More flexibility may be added later. </p>
<p>Before going to the second tab, check that no saturated images are detected by reading
the label below the right arrow button above the image. The relative saturation limit is
0.95 by default. A possibility to deal with isolated saturated pixels (broken pixels or
noise) is to use median filtering of the images. If this does not help, it is useless to
go further. Acquire new images.</p>

<h2>Tab2: Define the analyses to run</h2>
<p> Once the pretreatment is finished and the zero images are excluded, the images can be 
analyzed using the controls in tab2. Some controls do not trigger an update of the tab. 
To force an update, change image by using the slider or the arrow buttons. </p>
<p>First the background needs to be determined and subtracted. If the background is not 
homogeneous and you have a background image, use the controls in the first line:
Switch to 'Use a dark image' and give the number of the dark image (look it up in tab 1). </p>
<p>In the second line you choose the way how the homogeneous background correction is 
calculated. The simplest and fastest way is to use the average value inside or outside the 
ROI defined in tab 1. (If the red frame is around the beam, use 'outside', if the red frame 
is besides the beam use 'inside'.) The 'autocrop' which is used to generate a black frame 
of same width on all sides can be disabled using the checkbox. Disabling autocrop is 
necessary if the ROI is besides the beam. </p>
<p>The second method 'Use A<sub>eff</sub>-curve fit' needs some more explanation: The effective surface
area, A<sub>eff</sub>, of a laser beam is defined as the proportionality factor between pulse energy 
(Ep) and peak fluence (F): F = Ep/A<sub>eff</sub> (Or power (P) and peak irradiance (I): I = P/A<sub>eff</sub>) 
From a beam image without background and without noise A<sub>eff</sub> can be obtained by A<sub>eff</sub> = Ep/F 
= sum(pixels) / max(pixels). If the image is background corrected, adding more pixels of the
background in the calculation does not change the value of A<sub>eff</sub>. Thus, the A<sub>eff</sub>-curve:
A<sub>eff</sub>(image_size) is flat. This fact can be used to retrieve the value of the homogeneous 
background correction: (i) take a guess for the background, (ii) subtract it from the image, 
(iii) make the A<sub>eff</sub>-curve by cropping the borders of the image and (iv) evaluate the slope 
of the line through the last points of the A<sub>eff</sub>-curve. If the 'A<sub>eff</sub>-curve fit' is used to 
determine the background level, the inside/outside control is not taken into account. </p>
<p>In any case, it's a good idea to take a look at the A<sub>eff</sub>-curve (shown by default on the right 
graph). If the last points of the A<sub>eff</sub>-curve 
are not on a straight line, this is a sign of either inhomogeneous background or too close 
cropping (the edge of the image contains energy from the pulses low foothills). </p>
<p>After defining the background definition method, the method for the definition of the maximum 
has to be chosen from the upper right combobox. The choice should consider the number of pixels 
that are close to the maximum of the beam. If there are many pixels close to the maximum, the 
pixel with the highest gray level (Max Pixel) is likely to be a noise pixel and some smoothing 
method should be used ('...mean...' or 'cap fit ...') to avoid over-estimation of the
maximal GL. If the pixels are large with respect to the
beam size, smoothing needs to be avoided to avoid under-estimation of the maximal GL</p>
